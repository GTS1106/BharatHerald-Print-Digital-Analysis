# Bharat Herald Circulation Analytics Dashboard
## Problem Statement
Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper spread across five Indian states, faces an existential crisis as print circulation dropped steeply from 1.2 million to under 560,000 between 2019 and 2024. The pandemic pushed readers to digital platforms, with competitors adapting quickly. Bharat Heraldâ€™s digital pilot failed, resulting in advertiser loss, bureau closures, delayed vendor payments, and major layoffs. This dashboard was created to quantify the decline, diagnose problem areas, and guide a roadmap for digital transformation.
